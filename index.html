            <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
            <p> Hola Mundo, </p>
            <p> My name is Allan and I was born and raised in the Country Music capital of the world. I was intrigued
                by the world of technology from a very young age when
                I first heard of video-calling. The thought of two people in two different locations communicating
                through video caught my attention, making me wonder about how a random device has the
                ability to capture an image thousands of miles away and transmit it. These thoughts would follow me for
                the rest of my childhood and teenage years, as I would oftentimes find myself playing video games and
                wondering how it is possible
                that my video game character knows that I am telling it to move in certain directions or perform certain
                actions.
                Eventually, I heard about Computer Science through Microsoft and knew that I wanted to learn about the
                intricacies of Technology through my higher education. Fast forward to
                2015 (where video calling has become a basic norm), I moved further south to attend one
                of the nation's Top 5 Public Universities, the <b>Georgia
                    Institute of Technology</b>.</p>

            <p> At Georgia Tech I learned how to build systems to
                exploit computing’s abilities to provide creative outlets, in addition to, designing, building, and
                evaluating systems that treat humans as the central component. My early programming courses began with
                Python, though they quickly became Object Oriented Programming (OOP) languages like Java. I was also
                exposed to
                C, C#, D3, JavaScript, amongst other programming languages through my school courses.
                Aditionally, throughout
                my time at Tech, I worked as a technical support technician at the College of Computing. I helped
                maintain our college’s filesystems and networks, in addition to troubleshooting numerous of reported
                issues on a daily basis. Though, my interest in the web
                was inspired by a project based class where I tackled ReactJS for the very first time. And ever since, I
                have
                sought to learn more about the framework and how to apply it in the real world.

                That skill and curiosity would
                eventually
                lead me to
                my first internship position as a Full-Stack Software Developer at Dispersive Networks. There, I was
                extremely involved with ReactJS and exposed to Redux, and as I was responsible
                for planning and developing a complex web application (all demos and code are available below) from
                start to finish. This included working with API’s developed in GoLang and testing them
                with PostMan, as well as, implementing algorithms for proper CRUD operations on my tree implementation.
                Once my term was over, I quickly found another position and was hired as an intern at New Balance as a
                Front-End Web Developer. At NB, I worked with the site
                teams of USA and Canada to implement web designs into the site (in HTML and CSS). This included working
                with applications such as Jira to properly keep track of assignments and Salesforce to deploy my code
                into production. Some special projects I had the opportunity to work with while I was there included
                several landing page designs and NB’s Basketball page with NBA Star Kawahi Leonard.

            </p>

            <p>Now as a recent grad, I continue seeking ways to develop as I am constantly taking online courses during
                my
                downtime (especially during this pandemic). My interests remain on the Web as my aspirations revolve
                around Full-Stack Development,
                though I do plan on expanding into more work with Mobile Applications in the very near future. Ideation
                is
                my favorite part of development, therefore eventually I would like to begin my own Start-up.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have been
                blessed to work
                on a variety of different projects with all sorts of people and am only seeking to grow more; therefore,
                I invite
                you to learn more about me through my listed experiences and projects below. Thank you.
